What I understood so far: About github I've learned what is github and git.How to works and the git commands.
also  I gained  knowledge by working practically while working on the assignment.things like creating git repository and cloning it  locally than
working with git bash terminal to use various git commands . the git index which is the staging area between the working directory and repository.
the working is  is the local filesystem whenever we work on priject its  in working directory.
the git init command whch is used to create blank repository.
the git add comand is used to add file to the staging area.
git commit command adds changes to the repository and about the command git commit -m lets the user add commit messsage
the git remote repository is used by all colaboraters to access the code and it is hosted on code hosting services like github. 
we can clone repositories from remote repository.
when any commit occurs the git takes it from staging area and commits it.
the repository contains collection of files and the changes made to it.
git status command is used to check which files are staged and modifed untracked
git push command is used to transfer commits from local to remote repository
about the branches there is a master branch which is the deafult branch so if we want to add new changes we can create a branch.
the git branch name command is used to create a branch
 
What I donâ€™t understand so far: git pull origin,markdown format
